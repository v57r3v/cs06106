Instruction for CA3   Group Assignment
January 2025 Semester
Assessment
This assessment   is   100   marks.
It   constitutes 40%   of   the   overall   assessment. The   group   assignment will   cover   30%   and   the group presentation will   cover   10%.
Rationale of Group   ProjectThe   rationale   of   the   group   project   is   to   enable   collaborative   learning   with   peers   and   learning   to   work   as   a   team,   which   is   commonplace   in   the   workplace.   Students   learn   to   apply theories taught in class and textbooks to   real-world   situations.
In   line   with   this   objective,   students   cannot   reuse   old   assignments,   submit   projects   from   previous semesters, or copy essentially from sources, particularly   the   Internet.
Forming GroupStudents are to form. groups of 4 to 5 students   per   group. As   this   is   a   group   project,   each   member is expected to put his/her fair share of   the effort into it. Groups must manage their   groups effectively to complete this   project.Students should   resolve group dynamics   issues and seek   mediation   through   the   lecturer   as   early   as   possible.   Last-minute   mediation will   not   be   entertained.   If all   mediation fails,   students   may   request   peer evaluation as a final resort.Finally,   the   lecturer reserves   the   right to   assign   a   mark to   an   individual student different   from the   rest of   the group   if that student   is deemed   not to   have   put   in   his/her fair share   of   effort   into the   project.
Case Study:Small   and    medium    enterprises    (SMEs)   form   the    backbone    of   Singapore’s    economy,   employing    approximately    two-thirds    of    the    workforce    and    contributing    nearly    half    of   Singapore’s    Gross    Domestic    Product    (GDP).    As    digital    technology    transforms    every   sector   of   Singapore’s   economy,   supporting   SMEs   in   their   digital   growth   is   essential   to   ensuring   they   fully    leverage    digital   solutions   to    enhance   operations   and    unlock    new   revenue streams   . (SMEs   Go Digital - Infocomm Media   Development   Authority,   n.d.)To   facilitate   this   digital   growth,   the   Infocomm   Media   Development   Authority   (IMDA)   in   Singapore   launched   the   SMEs   Go   Digital   programme.   This   programme   aims   to   help   SMEs   adopt   advanced   digital   solutions,   improve   digital   capabilities,   and   seize   growth   opportunities within the   digital   economy.   It   provides   a   structured   and   inclusive   approach   to digital adoption for SMEs across various   industries.
About the Tourism (Attractions)   Industry   Digital   Plan (IDP)In November 2023, the Tourism (Attractions) Industry   Digital Plan (IDP) was launched   to   support    Singapore’s    attractions    companies    in    their   digitalisation   journey.   The    IDP   provides   step-by-step   guidance   on   selecting   digital   solutions   aligned   with   each   growth   stage across three key job functions within the industry:
•         customer service and engagement,
•         sales and   marketing, and
•         sustainability.The    IDP    also    offers      insights    on      how      attractions      companies      can      overcome      industry   challenges    as    they    pursue    digital    transformation,    helping    them    enhance    operational   efficiencies   and   deliver   better   customer   experiences   .

Group Task:
Your group   is tasked with assisting a Singapore   tourism   attraction   company   in   beginning   its digital代 写System Development Techniques 2025
代做程序编程语言 transformation journey.To support this objective, your group should   explore   how   the   company   could   introduce   a   revitalized   suite   of digital   solutions for   its   products   and   services.   This   suite   should focus   on   integrating   advanced   digital   tools   to   improve   digital   connectivity,   strengthen   digital   capabilities,    and    ultimately    enhance    the    company’s    ability    to      compete      in      the      digital   economy.Your   research   should   address   the   company’s   specific   challenges,   such   as   adapting   to   changing       tourist       profiles,       meeting         evolving         customer         expectations,         and         staying   competitive against local and   international   rivals.The   report will   document   the   methodologies   and   processes   you   learned   in   the   Systems   Development   Techniques   module   and   highlight   the   strategies   and   technologies   applied   during the   project.
